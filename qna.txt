Nesting: I nested contacts within traveler. I think it improved organization by having 
a dedicated key for contacts rather than lumping them in with the traveler name.

Arrays: I used arrays for destinations and activities to properly nest multiple objects. 
Believe me, I tried without it, it didn't work. This was the only option lol. But now
it's nice and tidy!

Scalability: The JSON structure can easily be expanded by inserting a new key anywhere.
For this assignment, I thought it was super simple just copy/pasting the activities array,
and just writing in a new key between previous keys as well.

Real-World Application: This data would be super useful in a travel app or API by logging
user data for example, hosting all of it under one object for one account. I could also 
imagine an invitation-type thing when specifically imagining an itinerary. Everybody
would have access to all of the travel data so they know every single detail in one access
point.
